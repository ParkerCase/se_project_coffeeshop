# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- For future updates to this project, I would like to add hover-over nutrition labels for the menu items. I find that in modern society, many are intrigued by the specifics of what they're consuming, and this would greatly benefit many people.
- I would like to expand on the recipes section, implementing baked goods and their tutorials, as well as a "make it at home" section.
